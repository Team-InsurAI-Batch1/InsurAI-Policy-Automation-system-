</p>

### ✅ Deployment Status: **Successfully Deployed**

The InsurAI application has been **successfully deployed as a full-stack cloud-based system** using modern hosting platforms. The deployment follows industry-standard separation of concerns for frontend, backend, and database layers.

---

### 🌐 Frontend Deployment

* **Platform:** Netlify
* **Technology:** React + Vite
* **Status:** Live and accessible via public URL
* **Responsibilities:**

  * UI rendering
  * Role-based navigation
  * API integration with backend services

The frontend build is generated using Vite and deployed on Netlify for fast, reliable, and globally distributed access.

---

### ⚙️ Backend Deployment

* **Platform:** Render
* **Technology:** Spring Boot (Java 21)
* **Deployment Mode:** Docker-based deployment
* **Status:** Live and running

The backend REST APIs are containerized using Docker and deployed on Render. The service handles:

* Authentication & Authorization (JWT)
* Business logic
* Claim processing workflows
* AI integrations
* Notification services

---

### 🗄️ Database Deployment

* **Platform:** Render (Managed PostgreSQL)
* **Database Type:** PostgreSQL (Cloud)
* **Status:** Active and connected to backend

The backend is connected to a managed PostgreSQL database hosted on Render itself, ensuring:

* Secure cloud persistence
* Automatic schema management via Hibernate
* Reliable access for deployed backend services

(Local development uses MySQL, while cloud deployment uses PostgreSQL.)

---

### 📧 Notification & Email Services

* **Service:** SendGrid
* **Purpose:** Transactional email notifications
* **Use Case:** Claim approval / rejection notifications

SendGrid is integrated to ensure reliable email delivery in a cloud environment, replacing traditional SMTP-based mailing.
